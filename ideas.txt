Some ideas for projects:

1. Realistic model of a Betz cell (which is basically just a really big pyramidal neuron)
2. Using evolutionary algorithms (neuroevolution) with realistic models of neurons to optimize
network activity
3. Running small network models on Arduinos
  --> connect cell outputs to pin connectors to measure voltages directly?
